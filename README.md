🧱 Flecode — Build Solana Like Minecraft

Flecode is an open modular framework designed to make building on Solana as intuitive and creative as playing Minecraft.
Instead of writing endless code from scratch, developers can construct their projects block by block — each function, event, and automation exists as a reusable component within the Flecode ecosystem.

Every block represents an on-chain capability: tokens, NFTs, DAOs, treasuries, oracles, and beyond.
Through Visual Blueprints, these blocks can be connected, triggered, and evolved to form complete Solana programs — transforming complex architecture into a simple, visual experience.

At its core, Flecode is powered by the Redstone Engine, an event-driven system that lets projects react in real time to on-chain data, prices, and user activity.
This means your logic doesn’t just sit on-chain — it lives, responds, and adapts.

All modules are stored in the Open Registry, a shared repository for verified components and community-made templates.
Developers can publish, fork, and remix blocks, creating a growing ecosystem of interoperable Solana tools.

Whether you’re launching a meme token, building a DAO, or experimenting with automated systems, Flecode gives you the foundation to turn your idea into a living on-chain world.
Fast, flexible, and open — Flecode redefines how builders create on Solana.
